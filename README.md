Improves the [crawl learndb](https://loom.shalott.org/learndb.html/).

Consists of two parts:
* A userscript to insert a special character in entry titles for easier searching.
* A usertheme to invert text and background color.

Installation
---------

Searchable Titles
---------

You will need to have the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) addon installed.

Navigate to the raw ```/better-crawldb.user.js``` file in this repository or [click here](https://github.com/stuartdb/better-crawldb/raw/master/better-crawldb.user.js) and it should install the script.

Inverted Theme
---------

You will need to have the [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) addon installed.

Save the ```invert-crawldb.css``` file from this repository somewhere on your computer.
Install the style by putting the file locations into Stylish 'Install from URLS prompt'.

Alternatively, since the style is so small, you may also just copy and paste the contents manually into Stylish.
